= Install and Start Using the Java SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Start Using the SDK

[abstract]

The Couchbase Java SDK allows Java applications to access a Couchbase cluster. It offers traditional synchronous APIs as well as reactive and asynchronous APIs to maximize flexibility and performance.

include::partial$beta-warning.adoc[]

The Couchbase Java SDK 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the API, reducing the number of overloads to present a simplified surface area, and adding support for future Couchbase Server features like Collections and Scopes (available in Couchbase Server 6.5 as a xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[developer preview]).
The 3.0 SDK also moves from `RxJava` to `Java Reactor`, along with other improvements to performance, logging, and timeout troubleshooting.


== Installing the SDK

The SDK requires Java 8 or later to be installed, earlier versions will not work.
Java 11 is recommended, which has various enhancements like lambda local variable type inference, profiling tools, and updated security features.
Most of the flavors available will do, although we might only provide support for OpenJDK and Oracle JDK going forward.
It has not been tested (and is not supported on) Java 12.

You can use your favorite dependency management tool to install the SDK. The following snippet shows how to do it with maven.

== Hello Couchbase

Once you have the Java client installed, open your IDE, and try out the following:

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=connect]
----

Couchbase uses xref:6.5@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
Here we will use the _Full Admin_ role created during installation of the Couchbase Data Platform.
For production client code, you will want to use more appropriate, restrictive settings -- but here we want to get you up and running quickly.
If you're developing client code on the same VM or machine as the Couchbase Server, your URI can be _localhost_.

Connection to the cluster is initialized by

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=bucket]
----

If you installed the travel sample data bucket, substitute _travel-sample_ for _bucket-name_.

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=collection]
----

The 3.0 SDK is ready for the introduction of xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] in an upcoming release of the Couchbase Data Platform.
The latest release, Couchbase Server 6.5, brings a limited _Developer Preview_ of Collections, allowing Documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to specified _Scope_.
Here we will use the `DefaultCollection`, which covers the whole Bucket.

[source,java]

include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=upsert-get]

KV Operations are described in detail on the xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[KV Operations page].
Now that you know the basics, you may wish to go straight to that page.
// -- or first see a complete worked example of using the Couchbase Java client, our xref:3.0dp1@sample-application.adoc[Travel Sample Application].
