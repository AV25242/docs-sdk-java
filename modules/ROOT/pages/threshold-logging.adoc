== Threshold Logging in Java

Response Time Observability is implemented as Threshold Logging in Java SDK from release 2.6.0.

[#customizing]
== Customizing

You can customise Tracer settings through the [.api]`CouchbaseEnvironment.Builder`.
Here is an example on how to customize our default tracer to reduce the time interval when the information gets logged:

[source,java]
----
Tracer tracer = ThresholdLogTracer.create(ThresholdLogReporter.builder()
  .logInterval(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) // log every 10 seconds
  .build());

CouchbaseEnvironment env = DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment.builder()
  .tracer(tracer)
  .build();
----

Follow along with our example of xref:tracing-from-the-sdk.adoc[Tracing from the Java SDK with Couchbase Server], to discover how to use tracing in the Java SDK for Response Time Observability.
