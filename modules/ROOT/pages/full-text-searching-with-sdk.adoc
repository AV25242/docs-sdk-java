= Full Text Search (FTS) Using the Java SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Searching from the SDK

[abstract]
You can use the Full Text Search service (FTS) to create queryable full-text indexes in Couchbase Server.

Couchbase offers Full-text search support, allowing you to search for documents that contain certain words or phrases.
In the Java SDK you can search full-text indexes by using the [.api]`Bucket.query(SearchQuery)` API.

include::4.6@sdk:shared:partial$experimental-pars.adoc[tag=fts]

Querying a FTS index through the Java client is performed through the [.api]`Bucket.query(SearchQuery q)` method, providing a [.api]`SearchQuery`.
Building a [.api]`SearchQuery` takes two parameters, the index name to query and the actual search query itself (kind of a statement).
Additional search options may be specified by using the [.api]`SearchQuer` as a builder, chaining setters for each relevant option.

This method returns a [.api]`SearchQueryResult` whose iterator yields the results of the query (in the form of [.api]`SearchQueryRow` objects).
It also exposes a `status()` for the request, some execution `metrics()` and `facets()` results if some facets have been requested.
Instead of iterating directly on the result, you can access rows as a list through the `hits()` method, and in case of execution errors you can inspect the error messages in the `errors()` method.
Note that partial results can happen in this case (and hits() will return them).
Instead of getting partial results through `hits()`, one can combine results and errors and get an exception through the use of `hitsOrFail()`.

The [.api]`SearchQueryRow` object contains the `index`, `id` and `score` properties, respectively identifying the exact FTS index that returned the hit, the id of the document that matched and a decimal score for the match.
It also contains optional sections depending on the request and the availability of all relevant settings in the FTS mapping.
Those are `explanation()` (an explanation of the plan followed by the FTS index to execute the query), `locations()` (a map-like listing of the location of all matching terms inside each relevant field that was queried), `fragments()` (a map-like listing of occurrences of the search terms in each field, with the context of the terms) and `fields()` (a map of the complete value of each requested field).
Most of these need that the index be configured to store the data of a searched field.

Bucket bkt = CouchbaseCluster.create("192.168.33.101").openBucket("travel-sample");
MatchQuery fts = SearchQuery.match("term");
SearchQueryResult result = bkt.query(new SearchQuery("travel-search", fts));
for (SearchQueryRow row : result) {
    System.out.println(row);
}

== Query Types

There are many different flavours of search queries, and each can be constructed through static factory methods in the [.api]`SearchQuery` class.
All of these types derive from the [.api]`AbstractFtsQuery` and can be found in the `com.couchbase.client.java.search.queries.AbstractFtsQuery` package.
It contains query classes corresponding to those enumerated in xref:full-text-search-overview.adoc[the FTS generic documentation].

It is important to distinguish between _query options_ and general _search options_.
Some options affect the search process in general (such as the [.param]`limit`, indicating how many results to return) while others only affect a specific query (such as [.param]`fuzziness` for a given query).
Because multiple queries can be combined in a single search operation, _query specific options_ can be specified only in the query object itself, while _search options_ are specified at the level of the [.api]`SearchQuery` class, using builder methods.

[source,java]
----
Bucket bkt = CouchbaseCluster.create("192.168.33.101").openBucket("travel-sample");
MatchQuery fts = SearchQuery.match("term")
    //query options:
    .fuzziness(2).field("content");
SearchQuery query = new SearchQuery("travel-search", fts)
    //search options:
    //will show value for activity and country fields
    .fields("activity", "country")
    //will have max 3 hits
    .limit(3);

SearchQueryResult result = bkt.query(query);
for (SearchQueryRow row : result) {
    System.out.println(row);
}

Here's some sample output for the previous query:

....
DefaultSearchQueryRow{index='travel-search_33760129d0737bff_b7ff6b68', id='landmark_11778', score=0.0313815325019958, explanation={}, \
locations=DefaultHitLocations{size=3, locations=[HitLocation{field='content', term='tea', pos=39, start=254, end=257},HitLocation{field='content', \
term='teas', pos=56, start=353, end=357},HitLocation{field='content', term='tart', pos=17, start=95, end=99}]}, fragments={}, fields={activity=eat, \
country=United States}}

DefaultSearchQueryRow{index='travel-search_33760129d0737bff_b7ff6b68', id='landmark_25547', score=0.02536160834515202, explanation={}, \
locations=DefaultHitLocations{size=3, locations=[HitLocation{field='content', term='tea', pos=33, start=191, end=194},HitLocation{field='content', \
term='try', pos=30, start=177, end=180},HitLocation{field='content', term='per', pos=57, start=337, end=340}]}, fragments={}, fields={activity=eat, \
country=United States}}

DefaultSearchQueryRow{index='travel-search_33760129d0737bff_8b80958a', id='landmark_26854', score=0.02079624734659704, explanation={}, \
locations=DefaultHitLocations{size=10, locations=[HitLocation{field='content', term='trim', pos=227, start=1255, end=1259},HitLocation{field='content', \
term='steam', pos=7, start=41, end=46},HitLocation{field='content', term='steam', pos=38, start=213, end=218},HitLocation{field='content', \

term='team', pos=59, start=335, end=339}]}, fragments={}, fields={activity=see, country=United States}}
....

== Query Facets

Query xref:full-text-search-overview.adoc#facets[facets] may also be added to the _general search parameters_ by using the [.api]`addFacet(String name, SearchFacet facet)` builder method on [.api]`SearchQuery`.
You can create facet queries by instantiating facets through factory methods in the [.api]`SearchFacet` class.

[source,java]
----
SearchQuery query = new SearchQuery("travel-search", fts)
    //will have max 3 hits
    .limit(3)
    //will have a "category" facet on the top 3 countries in terms of hits
    .addFacets(SearchFacet.term("countries", "country", 3));
SearchQueryResult result = bkt.query(query);
System.out.println(result.facets());
----

Here is the facet part of the result from the query above:

....
{countries=TermFacetResult{name='countries', field='country', total=451, missing=0, other=0, terms=[{name='United States', \
                count=217}, {name='United Kingdom', count=188}, {name='France', count=46}]}}
....
