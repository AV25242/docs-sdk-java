= Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java SDK Release Notes
:navtitle: Transactions Release Notes
:page-topic-type: project-doc
:page-aliases: transactions-release-notes

Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions is distributed as a separate library for the Java SDK.
This page features the release notes for that library -- for release notes, download links, and installation methods for the latest 3.x Java SDK releases, see xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[the current Release Notes page].

== Using Distributed Transactions

See the xref:6.5@server:learn:data/transactions.adoc[Distributed ACID Transactions concept doc] in the server documentation for details of how Couchbase implements transactions.
The xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[Distributed Transactions HOWTO doc] walks you through all aspects of working with Distributed Transactions.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.3

This is the third _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.
There are no major changes.
The main purpose of the release is to rebuild on top of the new beta release of the java-client, so applications can use both together.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0-beta.1.
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 or above.

=== Bug-fixes And Stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-127[TXNJ-127]:
Fixes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error when using the reactive API to perform concurrency inside a txn.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-145[TXNJ-145]:
ATR names are changed, to hash to their expected vbucket.
It is recommended to flush (remove all documents from) the bucket to remove ATR documents from previous releases.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-136[TXNJ-136]:
Fixes an erroneous `IllegalDocumentState` alert in edge-cases involving the `DurabilityAmbiguous` error.

=== New Features and Enhancements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-124[TXNJ-124]:
An aborting transaction will now attempt rollback before completing raising `TransactionExpired` failure, rather than leaving cleanup solely to cleanup process.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-131[TXNJ-131]:
Minor logging improvement.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.2 (9th September 2019)

This is the second _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0-alpha.7.
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 beta or above.

=== Bug-fixes and stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-728[JVMCBC-728]: This fix in the underlying Couchbase java-client prevented conflict detection from working correctly in all situations with durability enabled (which it is, by default).
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible, for this fix.

=== Breaking changes
As a rule, we do not make breaking API changes after GA release, and only consider them rarely during the beta period.
This particular breaking change aligns the transaction and Java libraries much better, makes for a more natural and usable API, and requires little porting work.

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-121[TXNJ-121]: Align with the Couchbase Java client,
by renaming the `get` method to `getOptional`, `getOrError` to `get`, and `TransactionJsonDocument` to `TransactionGetResult`.

=== Performance

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-40[TXNJ-40]:
Retry operations on many transient errors, rather than retrying the full transaction.

=== New features

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-85[TXNJ-85]:
(Experimental) Supported deferred commit for transactions.
Please see the documentation for details.
This feature should be regarded as alpha, as its API and functionality may change in the future; please feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-112[TXNJ-112]:
(Experimental) Allow the number of ATRs to be configured.
This can potentially be used to improve transactions throughput, but is currently experimental and should be used only with Couchbase's guidance.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-107[TXNJ-107]: Make txn metadata documents more consistently named by prefacing them with "_txn:"

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.1

This is the first _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.
