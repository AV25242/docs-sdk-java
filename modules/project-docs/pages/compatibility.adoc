:navtitle: Compatibility

[abstract]
Features available in different SDK versions, and compatibility between Server and SDK.

== Couchbase Version/SDK Version Matrix

Couchbase SDKs are tested against a variety of different environments to ensure both backward and forward compatibility with different versions of Couchbase Server.
The matrix below denotes the version of Couchbase Server, the version of the .NET SDK and whether the SDK is:

* ✖ *Unsupported*: This combination is not tested, and is not within the scope of technical support if you have purchased a support agreement.
* ◎ *Compatible*: This combination has been tested previously, and should be compatible.
This combination is not recommended by our technical support organization.
It is best to upgrade either the SDK or the Couchbase version you are using.
* ✔ *Supported*:This combination is subject to ongoing quality assurance, and is fully supported by our technical support organization.

[#jdk-compat]
== JDK Version Compatibility

The Java SDK is tested with Oracle JDK and OpenJDK.
Other JDK implementations might work but are not tested and are unsupported.
We recommend running the latest LTS version (i.e. at the time of writing JDK 11) with the highest patch version available.

The following JDK releases are supported:

* OpenJDK 11 with HotSpot JVM (recommended)
* Oracle JDK 11 (recommended)
* OpenJDK 1.8 with HotSpot JVM
* Oracle JDK 1.8

Please make sure you run on one of the latest patch releases, since they provide stability improvements and security fixes in general.
