== A Simple Query
Here's the basics of how to run a simple query to fetch 10 random rows from travel-sample and print the results:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=simple]
----

(Note that we won't be covering the N1QL language itself in any detail here, but if you're familiar with SQL you'll see it's very similar.)

The Java SDK will throw an exception derived from `CouchbaseException` if there are any errors.

== Streaming Large Result Sets
The Java API provides three distinct APIs for all services:

* The blocking API you've seen so far, that returns a `QueryResult` containing all rows.

* An async API that returns a `CompletableFuture<QueryResult>`.  This in turn contains a `List<JsonObject> rowsAs(T)`.  It can be accessed like this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=async]
----

* A reactive API, that can be used to stream rows.

The former two APIs buffer all rows in-memory until they can be returned to you.  With smaller queries this is likely to be fine, but for large data sets this could lead to Java `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions.

The recommended solution is to use the reactive API.  Reactive programming is a sophisticated paradigm that is rapidly gaining popularity for its ability to handle, amongst other things, streaming large amounts of data over fallible networks, while allowing error handling and backpressure.

The Java SDK exposes primitives from the https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor] library, most notably `Mono` and `Flux`.  We strongly recommend https://projectreactor.io/learn[learning] a little of this library first, and the following examples will assume basic familiarity with Reactor.

Here's how to perform a query and stream the results using the reactive API:
